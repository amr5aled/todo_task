# task

An example Flutter project that uses [Riverpod], [go_router], [Hive], [flutter_hooks], and [Freezed].
 


## âš  Important Notes
This project uses [DummyJSON] API. Please note that DummyJSON **doesn't apply your changes** when creating, updating, or deleting items. This project correctly implements those actions, but expect no data changes due to these API limitations.



## Features
Each feature demonstrates certain functionalities that are commonly used in a CRUD app.

1. [Todos](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/todos): Full CRUD operations, including **"add item"**, **"edit item"**, and **"delete item"**.

2. [Auth](https://github.com/dhafinrayhan/dummymart/tree/master/lib/features/auth): Managing auth states, allowing functionalities such as **"invalidate all data when logging out"** and **"redirect screens based on the auth state"**.

## Routes
```
Full paths for routes:
  => /
  => /login 
  => /todos
  =>   /todos/add
  =>   /todos/:id
  =>     /todos/:id/update
 
  
```

## Setup
1. Run `flutter pub get` to get dependencies.
2. Run `dart run build_runner build` to generate required files. You can also run `dart run build_runner watch` to generate files and let [build_runner] watch for changes and rebuild if necessary.
